# Implementation Plan

## Implemented Optimizations (Pre-Event)

- [x] 1. Database Performance Optimization
  - [x] Created `pg_trgm` GIN indexes on `users.email` and `users.phone_number` to dramatically speed up search queries.
  - [x] Configured the Payload CMS database connection pool (`max: 20`, `idleTimeoutMillis: 30000`) to prevent connection exhaustion on Supabase.

- [x] 2. Infrastructure & API Optimization
  - [x] Increased Vercel function memory to 512MB for all `/api/checkin-app/**` routes to reduce CPU throttling and improve response times.
  - [x] Optimized the `findTickets` database query to remove a redundant phone number search condition.

## Future Considerations (Post-Event)

The following items from the original plan were not implemented to minimize risk before the event, but can be considered for future improvements:

- Advanced client-side caching and offline support.
- Comprehensive performance monitoring and real-time alerting.
- Network resilience features like request retries with exponential backoff.
