# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The **Check-in Performance Optimization** feature addresses critical performance bottlenecks in the check-in system to ensure reliable operation during high-traffic events. This optimization focuses on immediate, practical improvements that can be implemented quickly without over-engineering.

The primary goal is to ensure the system is fast and reliable for 9 event admins using phones and laptops in crowded venues with potentially slow WiFi and 4G connections.

## Core Performance Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fast API Response Times

**User Story:** As an event admin, I want ticket validation and check-in operations to be fast so that I can process attendees quickly without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN validating a ticket by QR code, the system SHALL respond as quickly as possible, ideally under 1 second.
2.  WHEN searching by email or phone, the system SHALL return results quickly, ideally under 2 seconds, even with a large user database.
3.  WHEN checking in a validated ticket, the system SHALL complete the operation swiftly.

### Requirement 2: Efficient and Stable Database Operations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the check-in system to handle database connections and queries efficiently to prevent timeouts, connection errors, or server overload during busy check-in periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN multiple admins are checking in simultaneously, the system SHALL operate within the Supabase connection limits of the "Small" plan.
2.  WHEN database queries are executed for searches, they SHALL use indexes effectively to avoid slow, full-table scans.
3.  WHEN connecting to the database, the system SHALL use connection pooling to minimize overhead and manage connections efficiently.
