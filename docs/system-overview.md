# Orchestars System Overview

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with Payload CMS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **CMS**: Payload CMS (headless)
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob Storage
- **Authentication**: Payload built-in + Phone verification
- **APIs**: REST + GraphQL (auto-generated by Payload)

## Core System Components

### 1. Content Management (Payload CMS)

Payload CMS serves as our headless CMS and application framework, providing:
- Admin UI for content management
- Database schema management
- REST and GraphQL APIs
- Authentication system
- Access control
- File storage and management

Key Benefits:
- Type-safe development with auto-generated TypeScript types
- Built-in versioning and drafts
- Extensible admin UI
- Flexible access control patterns

### 2. Event Management System

#### Event Structure
- Events can be concerts, theater shows, or performances
- Each event has:
  - Basic info (title, description, location)
  - Multiple schedules with dates and times
  - Media assets (logo, banner, thumbnail)
  - Terms and conditions
  - Ticket pricing configuration
  - Status workflow (draft → published_upcoming → published_open_sales → completed/cancelled)
  - SEO metadata
  - Performer/artist information

#### Ticketing System
- **Zone-Based Sales**:
  - Dynamic zones per venue (up to 5 zones)
  - Zones are price-tiered (Zone 1 highest price)
  - No pre-selected seats during purchase
  - Post-purchase seat allocation for fairness
  - Configurable per venue/event

- **Pricing & Inventory**:
  - Each zone has:
    - Base price
    - Total quantity
    - Current inventory
    - Currency specification
  - Early bird pricing through promotion system
  - Support for multiple currencies
  - Real-time inventory tracking

- **Purchase Flow**:
  1. Customer selects zone and quantity
  2. System creates 20-minute hold
  3. Customer completes payment
  4. System allocates seats within purchased zone
  5. Tickets are generated and issued
  6. Confirmation sent to customer

### 3. Database Schema

Key collections in Payload CMS:
```typescript
collections: {
  // Event Management
  events: Event                    // Event details and configuration
  performers: Performer           // Artists and performers
  partners: Partner              // Event partners and sponsors
  
  // Ticketing
  orders: Order                   // Customer orders
  orderItems: OrderItem          // Individual items in orders
  payments: Payment              // Payment transactions
  tickets: Ticket                // Generated tickets
  seatHoldings: SeatHolding     // Temporary seat holds
  
  // Promotions
  promotions: Promotion          // Discount configurations
  userPromotionRedemptions: UserPromotionRedemption  // Promotion usage
  
  // Users & Content
  users: User                    // User accounts
  media: Media                   // Uploaded files
  pages: Page                    // Static pages
  posts: Post                    // Blog/news posts
  
  // Support
  faqs: FAQ                      // Frequently asked questions
  activities: Activity           // System activities
}
```

### 4. Integration Points

- **Payment Processing**: [To be implemented]
  - Payment gateway integration
  - Multiple payment methods support
  - Refund handling
  - Transaction logging

- **External Ticket Sales**: Future integration planned
  - Real-time inventory sync
  - Cross-platform reporting
  - Unified seat allocation

- **Email Notifications**: [To be implemented]
  - Purchase confirmations
  - Ticket delivery
  - Event updates
  - Marketing communications

- **Analytics & Reporting**:
  - Sales tracking
  - Inventory monitoring
  - User behavior analysis
  - Performance metrics

## Key Features

### 1. Temporary Hold System
- 20-minute hold duration
- Prevents double-booking
- Tracks user context (IP, user agent)
- Automatic release on expiration
- Configurable timeout periods
- Hold limit per user

### 2. Promotion System
- Supports early bird pricing
- Flexible discount types (percentage/fixed)
- Per-user redemption limits
- Zone-specific applicability
- Time-based validity
- Usage tracking
- Stackable/non-stackable options

### 3. User Management
- Role-based access (admin, super-admin, customer)
- Phone number verification
- Order history tracking
- Promotion redemption tracking
- Profile management
- Security logging

## Caching Strategy

- Homepage carousel of events uses Next.js caching
- Event pages are cached but updatable
- Real-time inventory checks bypass cache
- Cached components:
  - Event listings
  - Static content
  - Media assets
- Cache invalidation on:
  - Content updates
  - Inventory changes
  - Price changes

## Security Measures

- **Authentication**:
  - Phone verification required
  - Session management
  - Rate limiting on auth endpoints

- **Data Protection**:
  - Input validation
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - CSRF tokens

- **Transaction Security**:
  - Atomic operations for critical transactions
  - Audit logging
  - Payment data encryption

## Development Guidelines

### API Access
- REST and GraphQL endpoints available
- Authentication required for protected routes
- Rate limiting applied [To be implemented]
- API versioning strategy
- Error handling standards

### Database Access
- All database operations through Payload CMS
- Direct Postgres access for reporting only
- Migrations handled by Payload
- Backup strategy
- Data retention policies
